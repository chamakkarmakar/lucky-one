            <p>React is an open-source component-based Javascript Library. This library helps to create the view layer of the application. A React Application is made up of multiple components that are responsible for generating reusable HTML. Those components are written using a domain-specific language named JSX which also allows for writing the components using HTML, mixing with JS events. React internally convert the components into virtual DOM and finally output the HTML. Most of the Processing was done inside the virtual DOM. The Virtual DOM changes the actual DOM elements instead of reloading the dom every time which helps the application to REACT faster!</p>
